# IoT Drying System

This project is an IoT-based drying system that monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and displays the data on an I2C LCD display. It also sends the data to the Blynk app for remote monitoring. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller and allows for dynamic WiFi configuration using the WiFiManager library.

## Features

- **Real-time Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Measures temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.
- **Local Display**: Displays the sensor data on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Sends the sensor data to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.
- **Dynamic WiFi Configuration**: Uses WiFiManager to allow users to configure WiFi credentials via a web portal, avoiding the need to hardcode credentials.

## Components

- ESP32 Development Board
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display with I2C Adapter
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional)
